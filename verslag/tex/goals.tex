\chapter{Goals}
The first goal of this report is to explore the various ways in which network protocols and network driven applications are designed and implemented in various functional programming languages. The second goal of the report is then to distill from the exploration one or several specific styles of network programming that are most suited for implementing network protocols in functional languages.

\section{Exploration}
The various styles of network programming employed in the different programming languages will be explored by implementing a protocol in each one of the languages and styles that these languages bring to the table. The implementations will then be analyzed in terms of conciseness, robustness, accuracy, complexity, readability. % TODO is this a good list?

\section{Find the best solution or suggest one}
Once all different styles have been explored, the report aims to either select one or several of these approaches as an optimal network programming styles or to construct one from the various explored characteristics. The approach will be implemented for the most dominant functional language at this date, Haskell. % TODO unless I find a better language? :P
