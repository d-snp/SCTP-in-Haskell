\section*{Abstract}
In this report an implementation of a stream-based I/O style is compared to the currently standard monadic I/O style in Haskell by implementing the network protocol SCTP in both styles. It finds the stream-based style still has some merits, but the monadic style remains superior for this use case. The distance between the I/O action and its result in the stream-based style is too much of a burden.
